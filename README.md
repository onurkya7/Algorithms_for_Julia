# Algorithms_for_Julia

Julia is a high-performance, flexible language used for scientific and numerical calculations. Julia is a programming language developed for data science and scientific calculations. In this share, an effective study has been created for people who want to enter the Julia programming language by giving example algorithms. Console outputs of the algorithms are also given in the file.

There are 10 entry-level algorithms. Here is one of the sample algorithms:

Console output:

And at the end of the study, there is one final study. You can test these final observations in the julia explanation and observe what you do. You can share the observation results with my e-mail address.
Good luck..
